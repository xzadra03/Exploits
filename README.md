# Exploits

This repository is used as a databank for exploits which are implemented in Python (Django, Flask, standard) and serves as learning tool. These exploits are made only for educational purposes.
Applications are meant to be used only on local servers (127.0.0.1). 

# SQL Injection Tool + ReDos Tool
This application can be found in Exploits/exploit_web. Its main purpose is to interactively show SQL injection and ReDoS attacks.
Debug is turned on in case of error happening. It must not be used in production environment!

How to use this app:
1. Download this repository
2. In folder Exploits/exploit_web run following commands:
    for installing requirements:

    $pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

    in the same folder for running server:

    $python3 manage.py runserver

Server should be running on 127.0.0.1:8000.

3. Open browser (Mozilla Firefox for the best experience) and type 127.0.0.1:8000
4. Enjoy!


# Trojan attack (Comment code execution)
This Python script shows the comment code execution with the help of invisible U+2067 (RLI) character.
It is vulnerability mainly for open-source codes, where can be comment such as the one shown in the script added into code without notice and it can create denial of service by early return or other problems. 

How to use:
1. Download this repository
2. In folder Exploits/Trojan_attack run:
    $python3 trojan_code.py
3. Enjoy and experiment with the code!


# Pickle module exploit

This simple client/server application written in Python's framework Flask shows that pickle should not be used. Application is based on the simple app of David Hamann available here: https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/.
Its main purpose is to reveal data on server-side of the application. It is run locally on 127.0.0.1:5000

How to use:
1. Download this repository
2. In folder Exploits/Pickle download requirements by running:
    $pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
3. In folder Exploits/Pickle/server run flask server:
    $flask run

Server should be running. Try open browser and type 127.0.0.1:5000. It should show error Not found, because this app does not use templates.
4. Go to folder ../Pickle/client and open the pickle_exploit.py
5. In class RCE in method __reduce__() there is variable command which pickles and encrypt desired command which will be executed on the server. Try whatever command you want and then run.
    $python3 pickle_exploit.py
Script returns pickled and base64 encrypted command. Copy it (without b'', only the string).
6. With this command you can execute code remotely:
    $curl -d "pickled=yourstringhere" http://127.0.0.1:5000/pickle
In terminal, where server is running you can see that some command was executed (for example all folders are shown after ls -a is executed).
7. Try different commands and enjoy!
